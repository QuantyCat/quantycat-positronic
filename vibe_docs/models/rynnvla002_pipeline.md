Robot demos → RynnVLA-002 fine-tune → trained checkpoint → inference on SO-101.

RynnVLA-002 has two components:
- **VLA Model (256×256)** — text + images → actions. This is what we fine-tune.
- **World Model (512×512)** — images + actions → next image frame. Optional, not needed for SO-101 inference.

## Forked repo

We forked the original to [github.com/QuantyCat/RynnVLA-002](https://github.com/QuantyCat/RynnVLA-002) to store dataset-specific changes. Lives at `~/RynnVLA-002/` on the training machine.

Three files changed from the original:

**`data_lerobot/item_processor.py`** — updated `MIN/MAX_VALUES_ACTION` and `MIN/MAX_VALUES_STATE` from LIBERO values to actual screwdriver dataset values. Used to normalize joint values to [-1, 1] during pretokenization.

**`eval_solver_lerobot_action_head_state.py`** — updated `unnorm_min_max()` with the same action min/max. Inference-time mirror — denormalizes predicted tokens back into real joint values before sending to the robot.

**`data_lerobot/pretoken_lerobot_state.py`** — two fixes:
- Subprocess Python invocation changed from hardcoded `"python"` to `sys.executable` so workers inherit the conda environment
- Worker count changed from hardcoded `32` to `num_gpus * 16` — tuned for RTX 5090 (each worker uses ~1.15GB, 16 workers ≈ 18GB)

## Key Commands To Run

```bash
source models/rynnvla-002/run_scripts/setup.sh
source models/rynnvla-002/run_scripts/preprocess.sh
bash models/rynnvla-002/run_scripts/finetune.sh
```

---

## Config

All parameters live in `models/rynnvla-002/config.yaml`:

```yaml
input_dir: my_data/input_data
work_dir: my_data/training_pipeline
task_label: screwdriver    # short label for output filenames
robot: so101               # robot name — used in fine_tuning output folder

# Must be consistent across preprocessing, training, and inference
chunk_size: 20             # sub-actions per chunk (lerobot default — must match time_horizon)
action_dim: 6              # SO-101 has 6 joints
resolution: 256            # VLA model uses 256x256
his: 1                     # history length

# Training — all from RynnVLA-002 original paper
batch_size: 2              # reduce if OOM; 2 uses ~17GB on a 32GB card
num_workers: 16            # CPU workers for data loading
epochs: 40
lr: 5e-6
```

## Prerequisites — download model weights

Run once on the training machine before preprocessing:

```bash
source .env  # loads HF_TOKEN
python3 models/rynnvla-002/run_scripts/download_weights.py
```

Downloads to `~/RynnVLA-002/rynnvla-002/ckpts/`:
- `chameleon/tokenizer` — raw Chameleon tokenizer (vqgan.ckpt etc.)
- `chameleon/base_model` — Chameleon 7B weights in HuggingFace format (~14GB)
- `starting_point` — RynnVLA-002 pretrained checkpoint (~14GB)

---

## Steps 1–7 — Preprocessing

```bash
source models/rynnvla-002/run_scripts/setup.sh
source models/rynnvla-002/run_scripts/preprocess.sh
```

`preprocess.sh` runs all steps in order and skips any step whose output already exists:

1. Convert LeRobot dataset → per-episode `training_data/` folders
2. Generate conversation JSON from `training_data/`
3. Verify outputs
4. Calculate action and state min/max values → saved to `min_max_action.txt` / `min_max_state.txt`
5. Pretokenize — converts every episode frame into a `.pkl` token file
6. Merge per-worker records → `record.json`
7. Update training config YAML with `record.json` path

**What pretokenization does:** each frame is converted into a flat token sequence. Three things per frame:
- **Images** — front + wrist frames run through VQ-GAN, compressed into discrete tokens (slow GPU step)
- **Actions** — joint movements bucketed into discrete bins, encoded as tokens
- **States** — same for joint positions

Workers split frames evenly and run in parallel (`num_gpus × 16` workers). Logs go to `tokens/vla_data/logs/worker_N.log`. Each worker uses ~1.15GB VRAM — 16 workers ≈ 18GB on a 32GB card. Estimated time on RTX 5090: ~30–45 min for a ~36k frame dataset.

## Fine-tune

Run in a tmux session so it keeps going if you disconnect:

```bash
tmux new -s train
source models/rynnvla-002/run_scripts/setup.sh
bash models/rynnvla-002/run_scripts/finetune.sh
```

Detach with `Ctrl+B` then `D`. Reattach later with `tmux attach -t train`.

This calls `models/rynnvla-002/fine_tuning/finetune.py`, which reads all parameters from `config.yaml` and launches torchrun.

Checkpoint output: `$work_dir/fine_tuning/<task_label>_<robot>/`
Training log: `$work_dir/fine_tuning/<task_label>_<robot>/output.log`

**Key training flags:**

| Flag | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `--action_dim` | 6 | config.yaml — SO-101 has 6 joints |
| `--time_horizon` | 20 | config.yaml — lerobot chunk size |
| `--init_from` | `ckpts/starting_point` | pretrained RynnVLA-002 checkpoint |
| `--epochs` | 40 | config.yaml |
| `--lr` | 5e-6 | config.yaml |
| `--batch_size` | 2 | config.yaml — reduce if OOM |
| `--checkpointing` | enabled | saves VRAM by recomputing activations |
| `--ckpt_max_keep` | 3 | keep last 3 checkpoints |

If you get CUDA OOM at startup, reduce `batch_size` in `config.yaml` and rerun. With `batch_size: 2` the model uses ~17GB on a 32GB card.

## Single-GPU fixes (what we changed from the original repo)

The original RynnVLA-002 training code was written for multi-GPU FSDP. Running it on a single GPU required several fixes — all in the forked repo at `~/RynnVLA-002/`.

### Root cause: NaN loss on single GPU

Training produced NaN loss from step 0. After extensive debugging the root cause was: HuggingFace `from_pretrained(..., device_map="cpu")` loads weights to CPU and attaches `AlignDevicesHook` dispatch hooks to every submodule. Moving the model to CUDA afterward with `.to()` does not cleanly remove these hooks, and the forward pass produces NaN in bf16. The fix is to load directly to CUDA with `device_map="cuda"` for single-GPU runs.

### Changes made

**`rynnvla-002/pretrain_solver_awm_w_ck_action_head.py`**

- Load model with `device_map="cuda"` instead of `"cpu"` when `dp_world_size == 1` — avoids bf16 numerical instability from the CPU→CUDA load path
- Fixed `add_lora_to_model` to initialize LoRA parameters with `device=module.weight.device` — when the base weights are already on CUDA, LoRA parameters must also be created on CUDA or the forward pass raises a device mismatch error
- Unfroze `lm_head` in `add_lora_to_model` — the starting checkpoint zeros out `lm_head.weight` rows for action tokens (3:8195). With `lm_head` frozen, those rows stay zero throughout training, producing uniform logits for all action token predictions and pinning `closs` at `ln(65536) = 11.09` regardless of how many epochs run. Fix: added `"lm_head" in name` to the `requires_grad` condition so the output projection trains alongside LoRA and the action head.

**`xllmx/solvers/pretrain/pretrain_ck_action_head.py`**

- Added `SingleGPUWrapper` class — a thin `nn.Module` that mimics the FSDP API (provides `no_sync()`, `clip_grad_norm_()`, and `__getattr__` delegation) so the rest of the training loop works unchanged
- Modified `setup_fsdp_sync` to return `SingleGPUWrapper(model)` instead of an FSDP-wrapped model when `dp_world_size == 1`. Also calls `remove_hook_from_module(model, recurse=True)` to strip any accelerate dispatch hooks before wrapping.
- Fixed 3 occurrences of `loss_weights = torch.ones(65536)` — missing `device=` argument caused the weight tensor to land on CPU, which then crashed `CrossEntropyLoss` with "weight is on cpu"

**`xllmx/util/ckpt.py`**

- Reworked the `save` function to skip `FSDP.state_dict_type()` context manager when the model is not an FSDP instance — that API requires an actual FSDP model and raises an error otherwise
- Handled a HuggingFace `save_pretrained` bug in this transformers version where `_get_tied_weight_keys` calls `.keys()` on a list — fixed by temporarily setting `inner._tied_weights_keys = []` before calling `save_pretrained`, restoring it in a `finally` block

### Training config changes

- `batch_size: 2` — reduced from 8 (original paper) due to GPU memory. With direct CUDA load and gradient checkpointing, batch_size=4 OOMs at 31GB; batch_size=2 runs at ~17GB.

## Inference on SO-101

```python
from rynnvla002 import Solver
solver = Solver(resume_path="path/to/your/checkpoint")

task = "Put the screwdriver into the cup"
while True:
    obs = robot.get_observation()
    action = solver.get_action_wrist_action_head_state(
        front_image=obs["observation.images.front"],
        wrist_image=obs["observation.images.wrist"],
        state=obs["observation.state"],
        prompt=task
    )
    robot.send_action(action)
```
